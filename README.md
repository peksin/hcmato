This is someday supposed to be a hardcore snake game. I started out trying to
learn 16 bit DOS graphics programming with "Alex Russell's Dos Game Programming
in C for Beginners". The idea was to learn how to draw graphics without the aid 
of external libraries such as SDL, OpenGL and the like.

I went along with the tutorial where applicable and made modifications as 
necessary. I then branched out to make a game of my own out of it.

I've left a ton of comments as notes for my future self in case I need to come
back to this project later on.

Compiled inside DOSBox with Borland Turbo C++ 3.0

TODO:

-Sanitize snek length input
-Add snek collision with itself
-Prevent game from drawing collectibles on top of the snek

-Divide subroutines to modules
-Sound system
-Check for latency

NEXT LEVEL TODO:
Moving collectibles?
Multiplayer?
Explosion graphics?
High score -table?
Port to SDL or something similar?
